</p>

`huxdemp` is an highly advanced version of the venerable `hexdump`.

It uses colors, bolding, and other terminal formatting to distinguish between
`nul` bytes, ASCII whitespace, UTF8-control characters, ASCII control
characters, and normal printable bytes.

![huxdemp screenshot](img/normal.png)

Additionally, the colors used can be changed with the `HUXD_COLORS` environment
variable, unlike other hexdumpers. In the screenshot below, all characters
except `0xFF` was set to grey, and `0xFF` was set to red to make it stand out:

`huxdemp` also sports a Lua plugin system, allowing user-defined columns. In the
following screenshot, the builtin `uxn` plugin decodes
[uxn](https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/uxntal.html) opcodes and displays it
alongside the normal columns:

![huxd `uxn` plugin demo](img/uxn.png)

There's also a neat column reordering feature that can come in handy:

![huxd reordering](img/reordering.png)

Like @delan's [xd](https://bitbucket.org/delan/xd) hexdumper, `huxdemp` also
sports the ability to print output with the `cp437` codepage, which makes
spotting patterns in binary data much, much easier (see
[here](https://www.azabani.com/2020/11/15/xd.html)):

![huxd cp437](img/cp437.png)

Finally, `huxdemp` can also highlight bytes that comprise the same Unicode
codepoint:

![huxd `-u` flag](img/unicode.png)

### Why?

- `huxdemp` has hexdump's `-n` and `-s` flags (many "modern" hexdumpers don't have this!)
- `huxdemp` can "highlight" bytes that "belong" to the same UTF8-encoded character.
- `$HUXD_COLORS` can be set to customize color choices.
- Fully extensible with a Lua plugin system!
- Ability to print characters in IBM's code page 437 (see screenshots).
- Ability to print control characters using fancy Unicode glyphs (e.g. ␀
  for NUL, ␌ for FF (form feed), etc).
- Automatic display through `less(1)` when needed.
- Readable source, written in literate programming using a dialect of `unu`
  from [RetroForth](https://forth.works/).

### Why not?

- No octal or binary view. (This *might* be added later.)
  - Use [hex](https://www.azabani.com/2020/11/15/xd.html) if you want this.
- No "content sqeezing" that replaces lines that are the same as the previous
  lines with an asterisk.
  - Use [hexyl](https://github.com/sharkdp/hexyl) if you want this.
- No pretty line-drawing borders.
  - Use [hexyl](https://github.com/sharkdp/hexyl) if you want this.
- No OpenBSD support. (This will be worked on soon. Patches welcome!)
- Not written in Rust. (The horrors!)
- No Windows support.

### Install

#### Requirements

- A POSIX system. (Windows is unsupported at present.)
- For building from source:
  - Lua 5.2 or later.
  - [`scdoc`](https://git.sr.ht/~sircmpwn/scdoc).
  - A C99 compiler and GNU Make.

#### Arch Linux

```
yay huxd
```

#### Gentoo

```
sudo eselect repository enable dm9pZCAq
sudo emerge --sync dm9pZCAq
sudo emerge sys-apps/huxdemp::dm9pZCAq
```

#### Download

Download a binary tarball from the releases, unpack, and move the
executable into your $PATH and the manpage (`huxd.1`) to someplace like
`/usr/local/share/man/man1/huxd.1`.

---

#### Building from source

Clone (or download a tarball from the releases), make, and install:

```
$ cd huxdemp
$ make
    CCLD    unu
    UNU     main.c
    CCLD    huxd
    SCDOC   huxd.1
$ sudo make install
[sudo] password for kiedtl:
$
```

You might have to fidget with the `LUA` and `LUALIB` libraries to reflect
what version of Lua you have. On some distros, like Alpine, `LUALIB`
might have to be set to just `lua`.

### Usage

#### Basic usage

`huxdemp` works like you'd expect:

$
```

Consult the manpage (`man huxd`) for details on other flags.

#### Custom colors

The `HUXD_COLORS` environment variable is set to change colors. The variable
takes the form of separate statements, separated by `;`'s; each statement sets a
group of characters to a specific color. Each statement takes the following
syntax: `<range>=<color>`.

The color is from 0 to 255, use the following bash script to view all possible
colors:

```
#!/bin/sh
e="$(printf "033")"; t="Lorem 033[1mipsum."
i=0; while [ $i -le 255 ]; do
     printf "${i}$e[4D$e[4C"
     printf "$e[38;5;${i}m $t $e[0m "
     printf "$e[48;5;${i}m$e[30m $t $e[0m "
     printf "$e[48;5;${i}m $t $e[0m "
     printf "$e[48;5;${i}m$e[K$e[mn"
     i=$(( i + 1 ))
done
```

Examples:

```
0=1                  Display NUL in red.
23-25,27,28=34       Display characters 23, 24, 25, 27, and 28 in bright green.
0=1;23-25,27,28=34   Combination of the previous two.
```

Instead of a `<range>`, you can use a predefined range:

|Predefined range | Expanded value |
|:---------------:|:--------------:|
|printable        |      0x20-0x7e |
|unprintable      |  0x0-0x1f,0x7f |
|whitespace       |   0x8-0xd,0x20 |
|blackspace       |      0x08,0x7F |
|nul              |            0x0 |
|del              |           0x7f |

Two other special values can be used to change the colors for the offsets and
borders:

|Special value    | Description                                                       |
|:---------------:|:-----------------------------------------------------------------:|
|offset           | Sets the colors used for the offset markers. (default: 15)        |
|ascii_borders    | Sets the colors used for the ASCII column's borders. (default: 7) |

Here's the default value of `HUXD_COLORS` (not including `offset`/`ascii_borders`):

```
HUXD_COLORS="printable=15;blackspace=1;nul=8;whitespace=8;128-255=3;1-8=6;11-31=6"
```

#### Using plugins

When using the `-f` flag, `huxdemp` will look for a plugin if the value isn't
one of the builtin columns. For example, with `-f ascii,offset,foo`, `huxdemp`
will use the builtin `ascii`/`offset` columns, and look for a plugin called
`foo` in `$LUA_PATH`. By default that's in the current directory and in obscure
places like `/usr/local/lib/lua5.3/`, but you can set a custom plugin path by
appending the path (say, `$HOME/.config/huxdemp/`) to $LUA_PATH:

```
export LUA_PATH=<my_path>;$LUA_PATH
```

Arguments to `-f` that have a dash in it are treated specially: the part before
the dash is treated as the plugin name, and the bits after as the "sub-plugin".
So `-f foo-bar,foo-baz` will load just the `foo` plugin, and try to run the
`bar()` and `baz()` functions within that plugin's lua script (see the section
below about writing plugins for more info).

#### Writing plugins

Writing a plugin is quite simple: simply create a Lua file `plugin_name.lua`,
and define a `main(buffer, offset, out)` function in the returned module:

```
local M = {}

function M.main(buffer, offset, out)
end

return M
```

For each line, the `main()` function will be called.

* `buffer` is a table of the bytes for that line.
* `offset` is the offset from the start of the file.
* `out` is the stream through which output must be written. **Print output only
  through this stream with `out:write(<args>)`,** or your plugin will be broken
  when `less(1)` (with the `-P` flag) is used.

Here's a simple reimplementation of the `ascii` column, without colors or other
fancy features:

```
-- myascii.lua

local M = {}

function M.main(buffer, offset, out)
    -- Print the beginning border.
    out:write("|")

    -- Iterate over the bytes provided. If it's printable, print it; otherwise,
    -- output a period.
    for i = 1, #buffer do
        if buffer[i] < 32 or buffer[i] > 126 then
            out:write(".")
        else
            out:write(utf8.char(buffer[i]))
        end
    end

    -- Print the end border.
    out:write("|")
end

return M
```

As previously noted, plugins can have multiple columns defined in it -- for
example, the above plugin could have a `M.foo` function defined to define a
`myascii-foo` column which calls `M.foo()`, separate from the default `myascii`
column which calls `M.main()`.

The following APIs are available to plugins (just `require("huxdemp")` to import
them):

* `huxdemp.linewidth() → bool`: Returns the value of the `-l` option.
* `huxdemp.color_for(number) → number`: Returns the color used for a particular
  bytes, taking `$HUXD_COLORS` into account.
* `huxdemp.color_for_offset() → number`: Returns the color used for offsets.
* `huxdemp.color_for_ascii_borders() → number`: Returns the color used for the
  ASCII column's border.
* `huxdemp.colors_enabled() → bool`: Returns whether colors are enabled or not
  (with the `-C` flag).

---

### TODO

- Moar plugins! (See: [builtin/README.md](builtin/README.md)).
- Allow plugins to highlight bytes in byte column.
- A flag to "mark" the nth byte of the input, with both an absolute and relative
  position. (Is this really needed?)
  - relative: "huxd -m 0x34,12,0o45 < foo"
  - absolute: "huxd -M 0x34,12,0o45 < foo"
- Support for OpenBSD.
  - Use `pledge(2)`/`unveil(2)` as needed.
- Use skeeto's branchless utf8 decoder design to make this tool Blazing Fast™.
- Support Windows 10/11. (Very low priority.)
